// Fact lookup by binding pattern.
//
// The evaluator used to satisfy every atom by scanning its whole relation, so a two-atom
// conjunction was an unindexed nested loop: quadratic, and the shape of nearly every rule. These
// indexes turn the bound positions of an atom into a bucket lookup.
//
// Each value has one key (valueKey), and valueEq is key equality (#162), so a bucket holds exactly
// the tuples whose bound values equal the probe's. unify (EDB) and valsEqual (IDB) still decide each
// candidate, which costs a comparison and guards the index against a key that drifts from valueEq.

// patternMask marks which positional arguments of an atom are bound at solve time — a constant, or
// a variable the binding already carries. Wildcards and unbound variables are free. Positions past
// the width of the mask are never indexed on (see maskWidth), which only ever widens a bucket.

// maskWidth is the number of argument positions a patternMask can mark. An argument beyond it is
