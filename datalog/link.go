// Link returns q with every derived module it reaches expanded into its rules, so the result is an
// ordinary query that evaluates without the vocabulary's modules. Every evaluator, Validate and
// Reads link first; a host calls Link itself to inspect or cache the expanded program.
//
// Loading is transitive and by need, one relation at a time: a query naming net.has_test_point pulls
// in the rules defining net.has_test_point, then the rules of whatever those read, and so on. A
// member defined in the same module but never reached is not loaded, so a query pays for the
// relations it names, not for their neighbours: a cheap member and an expensive one can share a
// module. Each relation is loaded once, however many paths reach it. Module rules come after the
// query's own, heads renamed to full paths and private members to names no query can spell. The
// query's own rules are all kept, reached or not, so Validate still checks every rule its author
// wrote. Because the result is ordinary rules, stratification,
// negation safety and range restriction apply to module rules exactly as to a query's own.
//
// A query's own rules stay local and bare. Link refuses a query rule whose head is a qualified path
// (quietly adding a rule to a shared relation is the accident a namespace exists to prevent), names a
// module, or names a derived relation a module registered. It returns Check's error when the vocabulary's
// modules do not check.
