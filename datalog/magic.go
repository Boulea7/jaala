// magic is SemiNaive's demand-driven rewrite, the magic-sets transformation, run after unfold and
// before plan. A derived relation called with bound arguments is evaluated only for the values the
// query demands, rather than in full and then filtered. Asked reach("v0", ?x), the rewrite derives
//
//	m_reach_bf("v0").
//	reach_bf(?a, ?b) :- m_reach_bf(?a), edge(?a, ?b);
//	reach_bf(?a, ?c) :- m_reach_bf(?a), reach_bf(?a, ?b), edge(?b, ?c);
//
// so only reach tuples starting at v0 are computed. The "bf" adornment records which arguments are
// bound (b) and free (f) at a call; the magic relation m_reach_bf holds the bound values demanded so
// far. A rule passes demand on to what it calls: in reach(?a, ?c) :- edge(?a, ?b), reach(?b, ?c),
// demand for ?a becomes demand for each ?b, m_reach_bf(?b) :- m_reach_bf(?a), edge(?a, ?b).
// Everything is still ordinary rules, so semi-naive evaluation, strata and planning apply unchanged.
//
// The literals that run before a call (its prefix) are what the magic rule passing demand into it
// reads, and the rule they came from reads them too. So that they run once, a prefix that does more
// than read the guard is stored in a supplementary relation (supplementary magic sets, #54), which
// both read:
//
//	s1(?a, ?b) :- m_reach_bf(?a), edge(?a, ?b);
//	m_reach_bf(?b) :- s1(?a, ?b);
//	reach_bf(?a, ?c) :- s1(?a, ?b), reach_bf(?b, ?c);
//
// Right-linear recursion called from the goal with constants is factored instead (see factor): plain
// magic sets would derive a full answer set for every node the recursion passes through.
//
// Demand also starts from a constant in a rule that nothing demands, such as one the query defines and
// asks for with nothing bound (#57): uses(?t) :- covers(?t, "p.write") calls covers_fb, demanded by the
// fact m_covers_fb("p.write"). See fromConstants.
//
// Which arguments are bound at a call depends on the order a body runs in, so each body is ordered by
// the planner first, starting from what its head has bound. A call with nothing bound, from a body the
// rewrite guards, is demanded all the same (#60): it calls reach_ff, whose rules are guarded by the
// zero-argument m_reach_ff(), derived from the caller's guard. When no caller is demanded, nothing in
// reach is derived. A call with nothing bound from the goal, or from a rule evaluated in full, would
// demand it unconditionally, so it is left calling the original relation, which is evaluated in full
// as before. So is a call to a relation whose rule aggregates (#4). When the original is evaluated in
// full anyway, because something still reads it, the all-free calls read it too (see foldFree), so a
// relation is never derived twice.
//
// Demand passes through relations that use negation (#34), and into a negated call: in
// nocov(?c) :- p(?c), not cov(?c), demand for nocov becomes demand for cov at the ?c that reach the
// negation. Demand into a negation can make a stratified program unstratifiable (a recursive caller's
// demand for cov would depend on the caller, which negates cov), so when the rewritten program does not
// stratify, the rewrite is made again with negated calls reading their relations in full. That one
// usually stratifies, but not always (#93): demand flowing down from a rule above an aggregate can
// reach the relation the aggregate reduces, and a negation can still sit in a cycle the demand closes.
// When neither rewrite stratifies, the program runs without demand, as written, which stratify has
// already accepted.
//
// Nor does it run with demand when the rewrite would derive one relation under two adornments (see
// severalAdornments).
//
// Magic tuples record what was asked, not what produced an answer, so their citations must not reach
// an answer: SemiNaive's fixpoint derives them without citations (see SemiNaive.materialize). A
// supplementary tuple is a prefix's result, so it keeps its citations, and under Witnesses the
// witnesses of the literals it stands for (see idbTuple.parts). Under CanonicalCites there are none: a
// supplementary relation is a set over the prefix's variables, so two derivations differing only in a
// `_` would be stored as one, and the one kept would not be the one Naive's full comparison keeps.
