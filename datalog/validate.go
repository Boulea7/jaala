// Validate reports why a query cannot run, reading only the query and the vocabulary it would run
// against: the schemas of its base relations, its predicates and its derived modules, which it links
// first (see Link). No tuple is read.
//
// It exists because a rule compiled from a query used to be un-rejectable: RuleFromQuery returned no
// error, and the failure surfaced only when the rule ran, where it was swallowed into a clean pass
// (agni issue 540). Every fault a query can carry turns out to be static — an unknown relation, a
// wrong arity, a negation with nothing to range over, a projected variable nothing binds, a rule head
// colliding with a fact relation, recursion through negation — so the check belongs where the rule is
// BUILT rather than where it first meets a design.
//
// It cannot be implemented by evaluating against an empty fact base, which is the obvious shortcut.
// Solving stops at the first atom that yields nothing, so on an empty base every atom after the first
// goes unexamined and a wrong-arity relation in position two passes validation.

// it and still refused when it doesn't (#61). Only the names matter: each stands in as an absent
