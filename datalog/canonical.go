// CanonicalCites makes every answer's citations, and its witness when Witnesses is set too, the same
// whichever evaluator answers and however its rules are written or planned (#22). Without it a derived
// tuple keeps its first derivation, and the evaluators find derivations in different orders, so a row
// reachable two ways can cite either path.
//
// Each derived tuple, and each answer row, keeps its shortest derivation: the one with the fewest rule
// steps above the facts. Of those, it keeps the one whose rule comes first by its written text, then
// whose body facts come first by relation and values, in written order, and then a source's facts by
// their citations.
// The shortest derivation is the same however it is found, and the rest reads only what was derived,
// so every evaluator keeps the same one. It is also the easiest to check by hand.
//
// It costs work: a tuple derived again is compared with the one kept rather than dropped, and one that
// a shorter derivation replaces is derived from again, so its own consumers can shorten too. Like
// Witnesses, it keeps SemiNaive from inlining and factoring relations, which would change the steps a
// derivation counts, or from storing a body prefix in a supplementary relation (see magic), which would
// merge derivations it has to tell apart. Witnesses are recorded to compare derivations, but Row.Witness is set only when
// Witnesses asks for it.
