// bindSets turns each goal variable the host bound to several values, or to none, into a join with a
// relation holding exactly those values (#132). The relation is a set of facts, read first in the
// goal, so the answer is the union over the values and an aggregate reduces across them; the planner
// keeps it first (planGoal) and the demand rewrite starts from it like a guard, so a derived relation
// the goal calls with the variable is evaluated only for the values bound. A variable bound to no
// values ranges over a relation that derives nothing, from a rule reading only itself.
//
// It runs on the linked, coerced goal, after the checks made on the program as written, so its
// relation is never named in an error, and its literal has no written position, so a witness leaves it
// out. Each value is checked as bindGoal and coerceConstants check a single one: substituted into the
// goal, coerced, and checked against a closed Domain, so an error names the value refused. It is stored
// as a number when any place it stands in reads it as one, an argument or a comparison with a number.
