// A Witness says how one fact of an answer holds: the relation and values it proves, and either the
// citations a Source or generator gave for it (a leaf) or the rule that derived it with the witnesses
// of that rule's body (a derived node). A Row's Witness lists one per goal literal, so an answer can be
// drawn as the tree of facts and rules behind it rather than a flat set of citations.

// derived tuple costs memory a query that only wants answers should not pay.
