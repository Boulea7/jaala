// What a Source serves is normalized as the Base reads it, so by the time a query runs every value in
// a typed argument is that type and every plain number is written canonically (#162). A pin a Source
// stored as the number 3 in an entity argument reads as the text "3", as a query's 3 there does
// (coerceConstants); text in a number argument reads as its number when it is one; 1.50 reads as 1.5
// wherever it is. Text that says more than its number, such as 3.3V, keeps its text. Equality can then
// be strict, a number never equalling text, without a pin stored the wrong way going unmatched.

// normalizeTuples returns tuples with each value read as its argument's type (coerceValue) and each
// plain number written canonically (canonicalNumber). A value the type can't read stays as the Source
// gave it. The Source's slices are never written: a tuple that changes is copied, and when none does
// tuples itself comes back.
