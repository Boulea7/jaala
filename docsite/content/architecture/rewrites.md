The planned `SemiNaive{}` rewrites a query before running it, in three steps: inlining, then demand, then planning. Each produces ordinary rules, so the fixpoint, strata and checks apply unchanged, which keeps the rewrites fairly easy to reason about. Every step has cases where it stands aside, and we've come to think of those as part of the design, since a rewrite that makes one query faster can make another slower or wrong. Most of them were found the hard way, by a test. `SemiNaive{WrittenOrder: true}` turns all three off.

## Before rewriting

jaala drops the rules the goal can't reach, since they can't change the answer and a rewrite renaming what they read would leave them reading nothing ([#90](https://github.com/panyam/jaala/issues/90)). They've already been checked by then, so a mistake in one is still reported. The second example above shows the check that comes first: the error names `depends_on`, the relation as written, though the rewrite would have renamed it.

## Inlining

A call to a relation with one rule, not recursive, is replaced by that rule's body, so a constant at the call reaches the literals inside, where the planner can use it. It stands aside:

- for a relation with several rules, which a single body can't hold;
- under `not`, which negates the whole body rather than each literal;
- inside an aggregate that counts bindings (`count`, `sum` or `list` without `distinct`), since a derived relation is a set and its inlined body isn't ([#4](https://github.com/panyam/jaala/issues/4));
- in the rules of a recursive relation, which the fixpoint runs every round, so an inlined join would be redone each time ([#97](https://github.com/panyam/jaala/issues/97));
- under `Witnesses()`, so every relation keeps its own node in the witness tree.

## Demand (magic sets)

A goal like `depends_on("p190", ?d)` only needs what `p190` reaches. The demand rewrite gives each called relation an adornment, a pattern of which arguments arrive bound (`bf` is bound, free), and derives the relation only for the values demanded. In the first example above, that gives the same nine rows for under 1% of the work. A rule's body before a call is stored once in a supplementary relation, so it isn't joined twice ([#54](https://github.com/panyam/jaala/issues/54)). A right-linear recursion called from a constant is factored further, reduced to the set of nodes the walk visits, so a long chain costs linear work rather than quadratic.

Demand stands aside:

- at a relation whose rule aggregates, which is read in full, since a caller's binding names no value of the body;
- when demand pushed into a `not` makes the program unstratifiable, by reading negated relations in full instead ([#34](https://github.com/panyam/jaala/issues/34)), and when that still doesn't stratify, by not rewriting at all ([#93](https://github.com/panyam/jaala/issues/93));
- when it would derive one relation under two adornments, whose copies can cover the whole relation twice ([#96](https://github.com/panyam/jaala/issues/96));
- from factoring, for a relation with no base rule to start the walk from ([#91](https://github.com/panyam/jaala/issues/91)).

## Planning

Each rule body is reordered so that what's cheap and selective runs first, given what's bound. A comparison, a test like `str.contains`, or a relation whose arguments are all bound runs as soon as it can, and a host's generator runs as soon as one of its modes is satisfied, so a host never has to write a body in a particular order ([#36](https://github.com/panyam/jaala/issues/36)). A body the demand rewrite guarded keeps its guard first.

## Holding the rewrites to account

Every rewrite has to answer exactly as `Naive` does. jaala's tests run every query three ways, and a few hundred generated programs through all of them on every change, thousands more in `selfcheck.sh`. The cost side is held by work baselines that fail a change making a workload more expensive. The [testing]({{.Site.PathPrefix}}/architecture/testing/) page has the detail. Most of the stand-aside rules above were found by those checks.
