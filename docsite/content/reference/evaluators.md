title: "Evaluators"
description: "Naive and SemiNaive: what each evaluator does, and what it guarantees about its answers."
---

An evaluator answers a query over a `Base`. jaala has two, and three ways to run them, which all give the same answer and differ in how much work they do getting there.

- **`SemiNaive{}`** is the one you'll want. In each round of a recursive fixpoint it only revisits what the last round added. It derives only what a query's constants ask for (magic sets), and it plans each rule body so the order a rule is written in doesn't change what it costs.
- **`SemiNaive{WrittenOrder: true}`** keeps the semi-naive fixpoint and turns the rewrites off, running each body in the order it's written.
- **`Naive{}`** repeats every rule until a round adds nothing, in written order. It's slow on purpose and fairly simple to trust, so it's the reference every faster strategy is checked against.

```

## What's guaranteed

- **The same rows, in the same order.** All three answer every query with the same rows, sorted the same way, which jaala's own tests check on every change, against its hand-written programs and a few hundred generated ones, and `selfcheck.sh` against thousands more.
- **The same errors from the written order.** `SemiNaive{WrittenOrder: true}` fails exactly when `Naive` does, with the same message. The planned `SemiNaive{}` gives `Naive`'s error whenever it fails, and can succeed where written order stops (a body written in an order that can't run as written, which planning fixes).
- **Citations from one derivation.** A row cites the facts of the derivation that found it first. When a fact is reachable two ways, the evaluators can find different ones first, so two evaluators can cite different, equally valid evidence for the same row. Making that canonical is an open issue, [#22](https://github.com/panyam/jaala/issues/22).
- **Bounded by `Budget`.** Each counts its work the same way on every run, so a budget that passes once passes every time, for that evaluator.
