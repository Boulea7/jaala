# jaala's documentation site

The site at https://panyam.github.io/jaala/, built with [s3gen](https://github.com/panyam/s3gen).
This directory is its own Go module, so s3gen and its dependencies never reach jaala's, which stays
standard-library only and builds for wasm. Its layout and tests follow agni's docsite.

## Commands

```sh
make -C docsite run     # serve at http://localhost:8085/jaala/ (builds once; restart after an edit)
make -C docsite build   # build into docsite/dist
make -C docsite check   # build, then run every docsite test: the mission's exercise (#104)
```

`.github/workflows/docs.yml` runs `make check` on every PR and deploys `dist/` to Pages from `main`.

## Layout

- `content/` holds the pages, as Markdown with YAML front matter (`title`, `description`). A
  directory is a section, and its `index.md` is the section's landing page.
- `content/HeaderNavLinks.json` is the header nav, and `content/SiteMetadata.json` the site's name,
  description and links.
- `templates/` holds the page layout: `BasePage.html` with `Header`, `Sidebar`, `Content` and
  `Footer`, and one `nav/<Section>Nav.html` per section for its sidebar.
- `static/` is copied into the build as is: the stylesheet and the scripts for code blocks and the
  header dropdowns.
- `main.go` configures s3gen and the template functions pages can call.

## Adding a page

1. Write `content/<section>/<slug>.md` with a `title` and a `description`.
2. Link it from `content/<section>/index.md`.
3. Add it to `templates/nav/<Section>Nav.html`.
4. If the section has a header dropdown, add it to `content/HeaderNavLinks.json`.

A new section also needs its nav template included at the top of `templates/Sidebar.html` and a
`Contains $currentPath "/<section>/"` branch dispatching to it, plus an entry in the header nav.
`nav_test.go` checks each of these, so a missed edit fails `make check`.

## Examples

Every example on the site runs. A page shows one with `{{ demo "demos/<section>/<name>.yaml" }}` on
a line of its own, and the build runs it on jaala and writes the rules, the goal and the answer table
into the page. A spec looks like this:

```yaml
fixture: graph                # a fact set in demo/fixtures/, or leave it out
facts: |                      # more facts, added to the fixture's
  edge("d", "a")
program: |                    # the rules
  reach(?a, ?b) :- edge(?a, ?b);
  reach(?a, ?c) :- reach(?a, ?b), edge(?b, ?c);
query: reach("a", ?x) => ?x   # the goal
bind: {x: "c"}                # goal variables the host binds, as datalog.Bind does
cites: true                   # show each row's citations
expect: [[b], [c], [d]]       # the rows it must answer, in order
expect_error: "not stratifiable"   # or: the error it must fail with
```

Facts are ground atoms, `rel("text", 3)`, one per line or separated by `;`. jaala has no fact syntax
of its own, since hosts serve facts from Go, so `demo/facts.go` is the docsite's. A fact's text is its
citation.

An example that pins rows or an error must produce exactly that, and one that pins nothing must at
least run without error. Otherwise the build and `demos_test.go` both fail, naming the spec.
Pin whatever the prose around an example claims, so the two can't drift apart. Every spec has to
be shown on some page.

`demo.Run` is the one function that runs an example: the build, the tests and the in-page editor
(#107) all call it, with a work budget so an edited example that runs away stops instead of hanging.

## Live examples

Every example has an Edit button (`static/js/demos.js`). It swaps the source for a textarea with the
rules and goal, plus the example's own facts if it has any, and Run evaluates the edit in the
browser on jaala compiled to wasm (`wasm/`), through the same `demo.Run` the build and the tests use.
The build renders each example's spec into a `data-spec` attribute for the editor to start from.

- `make wasm`, which `run` and `build` both depend on, compiles `wasm/` and copies `wasm_exec.js` from
  the same Go toolchain into `static/wasm/` (ignored by git). Pages link both through `assetURL`,
  which adds a hash of the file, so a cached glue file never meets a newer module.
- The engine is about 4.8 MB, 1.3 MB gzipped, and loads on a page's first Run. A reader who never
  edits never downloads it.
- `make wasm-test` runs the `demo` package's tests compiled to wasm under Node (`go_js_wasm_exec`),
  so the code the browser runs is tested as wasm. `make check` includes it, so Node has to be on the
  PATH.
- `demo.Budget` caps an edit at 50,000 units of work. It's what bounds memory too: a cross product
  under an aggregate allocated about 3.6 KB per unit, and the old 2M cap ran a wasm build out of
  memory (#120). The docs' own examples need a few hundred units.

## Things that publish a broken page without failing the build

- **A stray `{{`.** Pages are run through Go's `text/template` before Markdown, so `{{` anywhere,
  even in a code fence, makes the whole page render blank. In a Go sample, put a composite literal's
  inner brace on its own line. `template_test.go` catches it.
- **A link to a page or anchor that isn't there.** Write internal links as
  `{{.Site.PathPrefix}}/section/page/`, with the trailing slash. `links_test.go` checks every one in
  the built site, anchors included.
- **A figure include with a wrong path.** `includeFile` returns nothing for a path that doesn't
  resolve. `includefile_test.go` checks every include.

## Writing

The same rules as the rest of jaala's prose: plain declarative sentences, "we" for the project, no
em-dashes, no colon-definitions ("The result: X"), no hype adjectives, no "not just X but Y". Say
what a rule is and show it with an example. Before a docs PR is done, run `/ai-tell-sweep` and then
`/prose-pass` (technical register) over the pages it touches, and say in the PR what they changed.

## Before and after screenshots

A PR that changes how a page looks carries screenshots of the changed section, before and after,
in both themes. The checks can't see layout: the first set caught a border drawn inside the code
block's wrapper (#115). Serve the base commit from a worktree and the branch side by side, with
`JAALA_DOCS_PORT=:8091 go run .` and `:8092`, then shoot each with Playwright (`fullPage: true`,
clipped to the section, with `localStorage.theme` set to `dark` and to `light`). Before starting a
server, check its port is free (`ss -ltnp | grep :8092`): a server left running from earlier keeps
the port, the new one fails to start, and you screenshot a stale build. Stop each by the PID `ss`
shows, with `kill`. A `pkill -f` pattern also matches the shell running it, and `fuser` may not be
installed, so a `fuser -k ... >/dev/null 2>&1` silently stops nothing.

The site documents `main`, not a release, and the footer names the commit it was built from.
