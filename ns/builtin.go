// A Builtin is a predicate the engine computes rather than looks up. It is exactly one of two kinds.
//
// A FILTER (Holds set) tests arguments that must all be bound, keeping a binding when Holds is true.
// Because negation runs the same test and asks whether it yielded, `not name(...)` keeps a binding
// exactly when Holds is false, so the two directions cannot disagree. An unbound argument is an
// error, the same shape as an unbound comparison operand.
//
// A GENERATOR (Gen set) PRODUCES values, enumerating solutions from wherever the host keeps them.
// That is the property that makes clause order matter: a generator whose own input is unbound
// enumerates from every candidate, so appearing first in a rule body is a whole-dataset scan no later
// literal can undo. Modes says which bindings a generator accepts, so an engine can schedule it once
// one is satisfied and refuse a body that can never satisfy any. A generator must also only ever emit
// values drawn from
// finite host data, or evaluation stops being guaranteed to terminate.

	// says so with an all-false mode, so a full scan is a declaration rather than an accident.
	//
	// It is required for a generator, with every mode as long as the generator's longest call (MaxArity

	// bound argument is dropped there rather than in Gen. src is the Source the query runs over, for a generator
	// that reads the host's data through it.
	//
	// The engine copies what it needs out of vals and cites before emit returns and never keeps
	// either slice, so a generator may reuse one buffer for every solution it emits.

	// ctx is the query's: when it is cancelled or its deadline passes, Gen should stop and return
	// ctx.Err(), so a long walk does not outlive the request that asked for it. emit also returns an
	// error when the query stops (cancelled, or over its work budget, which counts every emitted
